This can be achieved by using a `WHERE` clause to check for the presence of `dob` and the absence of `dod`.\n\n2. **Calculate Age**: To determine if a patient is in their 30s, we need to calculate their age.

This can be achieved by filtering the `chartevents` table based on the current date and the patient ID, and then excluding any tests that have already been completed (i.e., have a non-null `valuenum`).\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Tests Scheduled for Today**: Use the `chartevents` table to find all tests scheduled for the patient with `subject_id = 22449` on the current date (`DATE('now')`).\n\n2. **Filter Out Completed Tests**: Exclude tests that have already been completed by checking that `valuenum` is null.\n\n3. **Retrieve Test Details**: Join the `chartevents` table with the `d_items` table to get the labels of the tests.\n\nBased on these steps, the SQL query can be written as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT T2.label\nFROM chartevents T1\nJOIN d_items T2 ON T1.itemid = T2.itemid\nWHERE T1.subject_id = 22449\nAND T1",

The question seeks to list all unique drug manufacturers that are present in the database. Based on the schema, the `prescriptions` table contains a `drug` column which lists the drugs and their manufacturers. Therefore, we need to extract the unique drug manufacturers from this table.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the table that contains drug information (`prescriptions`).\n2. Identify the column that contains drug names and manufacturers (`drug`).\n3. Use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure that we only get unique drug manufacturers.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the SQL query to list all unique drug manufacturers in the database is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT drug \nFROM prescriptions;\n```\n\nThis query selects all distinct drug names from the `prescriptions` table, which implicitly includes the manufacturers as part of the drug name.",

Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided schema.\n\nSince the question cannot be answered due to the lack of relevant data, I will provide a SQL query that would be correct if latitude data were available. However, this query will not return any results because the necessary data is not present in the schema.\n\nHere is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(latitude) AS average_latitude\nFROM patients\nJOIN (\n    SELECT subject_id, AVG(latitude) AS latitude\n    FROM chartevents\n    WHERE itemid = (\n        SELECT itemid\n        FROM d_items\n        WHERE label = 'Latitude'\n    )\n    GROUP BY subject_id\n) AS patient_latitude ON patients.subject_id = patient_latitude.subject_id\nWHERE patients.gender = 'M';\n```\n\nThis query assumes that there is a `chartevents` table with a specific `itemid` that represents latitude data.
